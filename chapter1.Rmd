# IODS - The most awesome course of the season :)

Introduction to open data science is a new exciting course. I am thrilled to take it. 
My brand new GitHub account can be found: https://ptolli.github.io/IODS-project/

The first week exercise was nice an easy. Next week it will probably be a bit more hard work
